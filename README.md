# AI Roundtable (The "War Room") 🛡️

**AI Roundtable** is a Chrome Extension that transforms your browser into a command center for orchestrating debates between multiple AI models. 

It connects to your **already open** tabs of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Google AI Studio, allowing you to:
1.  **Broadcast** a single prompt to all of them at once.
2.  **Context Injection**: Automatically feed the chat history from other agents into the current prompt (e.g., tell Gemini what ChatGPT just said).
3.  **Harvest** responses back into a single, unified "War Room" panel.
4.  **Edit & Curate**: Fix formatting or remove hallucinations from the history before the next round.

> **Note**: This extension acts as a "puppet master" for your browser tabs. It does **not** requires API keys. It requires you to be logged into the respective AI services in your browser.

## ✨ Features

*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Support for **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini (App)**, and **Google AI Studio**.
*   **Roundtable Context**: "Include History" toggle automatically injects the entire conversation log into your next prompt, enabling AIs to "hear" and respond to each other.
*   **Smart Context**: Automatically excludes an agent's *own* previous messages from the prompt sent to them (preventing redundancy).
*   **Session Persistence**: Your War Room state is saved locally. Close the browser and come back later.
*   **Privacy First**: All data lives in your `chrome.storage.local`. No external servers.
